# Dictionary Web App

Dictionary app, based on a [FrontEndMentor.io premium challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL)

As I don't have a premium FrontEndMentor account, I did this layout manually, using the provided JPG images as reference, and adding a few changes.
